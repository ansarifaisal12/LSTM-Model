# LSTM-Model
Time Series Forecasting with LSTM
This repository contains an example of using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to forecast time series data. The code is written in Python and uses the following packages:

numpy for numerical computation
matplotlib for data visualization
pandas for data manipulation
keras for building and training the LSTM model
sklearn for data preprocessing
The dataset used in this example is the "airline-passengers" dataset, which can be downloaded from my LSTM Model.
#Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
Download the dataset and place it in the root of the project directory
Install the necessary packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code: python main.py
The code will load the data, prepare it by normalizing and splitting it into training and test sets, reshape it, create and fit an LSTM model with the data, train the model, and make predictions. The predictions are then visualized using matplotlib.

This code serves as an example of how to use LSTM to forecast time series data. You can adjust the parameters, add more layers and tweak the code to suit your specific use case.


#Data Preparation
The data is loaded using the pandas library and read in from the airline-passengers.csv file. The data is then converted to a float32 data type for use in the model. The data is then normalized using the MinMaxScaler from the sklearn library, which scales the data between 0 and 1.

The data is then split into training and test sets, with 67% of the data used for training and 33% used for testing. The split is done using the train_test_split function from the sklearn library.

#Model Creation and Training
A helper function create_dataset is defined to convert an array of values into a dataset matrix. The function takes the dataset and a look_back value as input, and returns the input and output data as numpy arrays.

The data is then reshaped into the format [samples, time steps, features], which is the format required by LSTM.

The LSTM model is created using the Sequential class from the keras library. The model is then added with one LSTM layer and one Dense layer. The model is then compiled with the mean_squared_error loss function and the adam optimizer. The model is then fit to the training data using the fit method, and the training process is set to run for 100 epochs.

#Predictions and Visualization
#Conclusion
This code provides a simple example of how to use LSTM to forecast time series data. It can be used as a starting point for more complex and in-depth time series forecasting projects. However, it's important to note that this is a simple example and may not work well for all time series data. More complex models and techniques may be required for forecasting more challenging time series.
